### Employee Tracking System
To develop the Employee Tracking System as per the requirements, we will break down the implementation into several key components. Below is a high-level overview of the steps and technologies involved:

---

### **1. Project Setup**
- **Spring Boot Initialization**: Using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to bootstrap the project with the following dependencies:
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Security
  - OAuth2 Client
  - Spring Cache
  - MySQL Driver (or H2 for in-memory database)
  - Lombok (for reducing boilerplate code)
  - Spring Boot DevTools (for development)
  - JUnit and Mockito (for testing)

### **2. Database Design**
- **Entities**:
  - `Employee`: Fields like `id`, `name`, `email`, `department`, `projects`, etc.
  - `Department`: Fields like `id`, `name`, `budget`, `employees`, `projects`, etc.
  - `Project`: Fields like `id`, `name`, `budget`, `department`, `employees`, etc.

- **Relationships**:
  - `Employee` ↔ `Department`: Many-to-One
  - `Employee` ↔ `Project`: Many-to-Many
  - `Department` ↔ `Project`: One-to-Many

- **Database Configuration**:
  - Configuring `application.properties` or `application.yml` for database connection (MySQL or H2).

---

### **3. CRUD Operations**
- **Repositories**:
  - Using `JpaRepository` for `EmployeeRepository`, `DepartmentRepository`, and `ProjectRepository`.
  - Writing custom queries using `@Query` for advanced operations.

- **Services**:
  - Implementing `EmployeeService` to handle business logic.

- **Controllers**:
  - Creating RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
   

---

### **4. OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect Integration**
- **Spring Security Configuration**:
  - Configuring OAuth2.0 with an external Identity Provider (e.g., Google).
  - Use `@EnableWebSecurity` and `@EnableOAuth2Client` annotations.
  - Define roles (`ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `EMPLOYEE`) and secure endpoints using `@PreAuthorize`.

- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - ADMIN: Full access to all endpoints.
  - MANAGER: Access to employees and projects within their department.
  - EMPLOYEE: Access to their own profile and assigned projects.

---

### **5. API Endpoints**
- **Employee Endpoints**:
  - `GET /employees`: Fetch all employees (ADMIN, MANAGER).
  - `GET /employees/{id}`: Fetch employee by ID (ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE).
  - `POST /employees`: Create a new employee (ADMIN).
  - `PUT /employees/{id}`: Update employee details (ADMIN, MANAGER).
  - `DELETE /employees/{id}`: Delete an employee (ADMIN).

---

### **6. Caching Implementation**
- **Spring Cache**:
  - Using `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, and `@CacheEvict` annotations for caching.
  - Configure caching provider (e.g., EhCache or Redis) in `application.properties`.

- **Cache Invalidation**:
  - Invalidating cache on updates or deletions to ensure data consistency.

---

### **7. Data Validation and Error Handling**
- **Validation**:
  - Using `@Valid` and Hibernate Validator annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.) for input validation.

- **Exception Handling**:
  - Creating a `GlobalExceptionHandler` class with `@ControllerAdvice` to handle exceptions and return meaningful error messages.

---

### **8. Unit Testing**
- **JUnit and Mockito**:
  - Writing unit tests for controllers, services, and repositories.
  - Testing CRUD operations, custom queries, and role-based access.

- **Test Cases**:
  - Testing authenticated and unauthenticated access to endpoints.
  - Testing caching behavior and cache invalidation.
  - Testing error handling and validation.
